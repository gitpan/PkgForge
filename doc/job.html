<h1>Package Forge - Build Jobs</h1>

<p>Central to the design of the Package Forge system is the concept of
a <em>build job</em> which is what the user submits. In essence a
build job has a unique identifier and consists of a set of, one or
more, source packages along with some instructions which tell the
target build systems how and where the packages should be built and
submitted.</p>

<h2>The Job Class</h2>

<p>A build job is represented by the <code>PkgForge::Job</code>
class. This has the following important attributes:</p>

<h3>The Identifier</h3>

<p>
This can be any string the user chooses which has not been previously
seen by the system. The only limitation on the contents is that placed
by the column definition in the job table of the registry database,
this requires it to be a maximum of 50 characters long. If the user
does not select their own tracking identifier then a Universally
Unique Identifiers (UUID) is generated using
the <code>Data::UUID</code> module.
</p>

<h3>Platforms</h3>

<p>
This controls the set of platforms for which the build job should be
submitted. By default, if the user does not express an opinion, all
supported, active platforms will be selected. As well as the
straightforward, positive inclusive approach of just listing the
suitable target platforms (e.g. &quot;sl5, f13&quot) it is possible to
exclude particular unsuitable platforms from the whole set
(e.g. &quot;!f13&quot;).
</p>

<p>
In PkgForge terminology a platform name is based only on the
distribution name and version (e.g. &quot;f13&quot; or
&quot;sl5&quot;). The platform name does <strong>not</strong> contain
any reference to the architecture. Note that this is different from
LCFG which appends an &quot;_64&quot; for the x86_64 architecture. The
target architectures are handled separately, see below for details.
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that there are no limits on the strings which can
be placed in the list of platforms. Anything which refers to a
platform which does not exist will be ignored, no errors are
reported. However, a helpful warning is given on the web interface
when it spots that a submitted job refers to unsupported or inactive
platforms.
</p>

<h3>Architectures</h3>

<p>
The architecture list is used in a very similar way to the platform
list. This controls the set of architectures for which the build job
should be submitted. By default, if the user does not express an
opinion, all architectures for the selected platforms will be
selected. Again, as well as the straightforward, positive inclusive
approach of just listing the suitable target architectures
(e.g. &quot;i386, x86_64&quot) it is possible to exclude particular
unsuitable architectures from the whole set
(e.g. &quot;!x86_64&quot;).
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that there are no limits on the strings which can
be placed in the list of architectures. Anything which refers to a
platform which does not exist will be ignored, no errors are
reported. However, a helpful warning is given on the web interface
when it spots that a submitted job refers to unsupported or inactive
architectures.
</p>

<p>
Further to this, it is worth noting that there are some limits on what
can be achieved with this method of specifying the platform and
architecture lists. If a job should be built for different
architectures on different platforms (e.g. i386-only on sl5 but all on
f13) then it will need to be submitted as multiple separate jobs. It
is not expected that this will cause much difficulty.
</p>

<h3>The Source Packages</h3>

<p>
Clearly the most important part of a build job is the set of source
packages which should be built. A job may contain one or more source
packages of multiple file types. Any file type which has an associated
Perl class which implements the <code>PkgForge::Source</code> Moose
role can be added to a job. Individual build daemons will filter the
set of source packages and only attempt to build from those which are
appropriate (e.g. an RPM builder might only choose SRPMs). This
feature makes it very easy for a user to submit a job for all
platforms without needing prior knowledge as to which will support a
particular file type.
</p>

<p>
When a job is submitted the source packages are validated and the SHA1
sums are calculated. These are then used throughout the system to
ensure that the source package files remain consistent. The validation
varies from type to type but includes basics such as checks that the
file exists and is of a non-zero size. For example, the SRPM source
package type also checks that the package is a valid source RPM.
</p>

<p>
The builds of the source packages will be attempted in the order that
they are specified by the user.  When building a set of packages some
platforms will stop immediately when an error is encountered, on
others the build will move onto the next package and the failed
package will be retried later. See the documentation for the relevant
build daemon for full details.
</p>

<h3>The Package Bucket</h3>

<p>
The package bucket is LCFG/DICE terminology for a directory in which
built packages are stored. In the Package Forge build system the
bucket is typically used for two related issues. The first is the
selection of the build system configuration to be used and the second
is the selection of the location into which built packages will be
stored.
</p>

<p>
There are no restrictions on what the user can set as the bucket for a
submitted job. The knowledge of which buckets are supported is only
available to the build daemons (and varies on each platform) so the
incoming queue processor cannot check for validity. Depending on the
build system being used an incorrect bucket name could trigger an
error and cause a complete failure to build the job. 
<p>

<p>
The bucket name <strong>must</strong> be specified by the user. Where
it is not applicable a build daemon may choose to completely ignore
the bucket though, in which case it can be set to anything the user
chooses. For example, an external site using their own pkgforge system
may choose to put all packages into a single location or may not use
the pkgsubmit tool.
</p>

<p>
The RPM builder uses mock to make packages. On these platforms the
mock configuration is closely related to the directory to be used for
storing built packages. Packages in certain directories should only
have build-dependencies on packages in other particular
directories. For example, on F13 the LCFG packages in
the <code>lcfg</code> bucket should only depend on software which is
in F13 or already in the bucket. There should not be any dependencies
on packages in buckets with license restrictions
(e.g. <code>inf</code> or <code>uoe</code>). The list of buckets is
site-dependent, see local documentation for details.
</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>

<p>
Currently Package Forge only supports sending reports via email. The
report attribute is used to specify the (comma-separated) list of
email addresses to which a report should be sent after each build job
is completed. If nothing is specified then no reports will be sent.
</p>

<p>
Due to the way in which a job is split into multiple tasks, one for
each target platform, a separate report is sent for each task. So, for
example, one submitted job may generate four reports
(<code>sl5/i386</code>,
<code>sl5/x86_64</code>, <code>f13/i386</code>, <code>f13/x86_64</code>). There
is no way to easily aggregate the messages as the data is stored
separately for each task.
</p>


<h2>Submitting a new job</h2>

<p>A build job is submitted as a directory which contains all the
source packages and a meta-data manifest file. This directory is
placed into a standard location in the file-system where the user has
write access. In the School of Informatics the file-system used is AFS
so that a build job may be submitted from anywhere.</p>

<p>
Build jobs are submitted using the <code>submit</code> command of
the <code>pkgforge</code> command-line tool. Here is the current short
help-text for the command:
</p>

<pre>
pkgforge submit [-aBcpr] [long options...]
	--verbose           Verbose output
	-c --configfile     The configuration file for this application
	-a --archs          The architectures for which packages should be built
	--target            Location into which jobs should be submitted
	--id                The unique identifier for this job
	-p --platforms      The platforms on which packages should be built
	-B --bucket         The bucket to which the packages will be submitted.
	-r --report         Email addresses to which build reports will be sent
</pre>

<p>
Most of these options (<code>--archs</code>, <code>--platforms</code>,
<code>--id</code>, <code>--bucket</code> and <code>--report</code>)
have already been discussed above. It is unlikely that it will ever be
necessary to set the target option, this controls where the new build
job should be stored and the default should be correct. It is entirely
possible to use the submission tool with multiple separate pkgforge
systems though in which the target option is essential. The only other
option which might come in handy is that for changing the
configfile. Again, if multiple pkgforge systems are being used it
might be necessary to have different configurations for each. The
standard configuration file handling is discussed below.
</p>

<h3>Job Submission Examples</h3>

<p>Submitting a job for only F13 (both i386 and x86_64
architectures):</p>

<pre>
$ pkgforge submit --bucket lcfg --platform f13 foobar-1-2.src.rpm
</pre>

<p>Submitting a job for all platforms except SL5 (again, for all
  architectures):</p>

<pre>
$ pkgforge submit --bucket world --platform '!sl5' foobar-1-2.src.rpm
</pre>

<p>Email reports are needed:</p>

<pre>
$ pkgforge submit --bucket devel --report somebody@example.org foobar-1-2.src.rpm
</pre>

<h3>Job Submission Configuration</h3>

<p>
For the job submission tool the following configuration files are
examined and, if they exist, the contents are used to set the default
values for the submission client options. Values for options set in
files which are later in the list override any values from files which
are earlier in the list.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>/etc/pkgforge/pkgforge.yml</code></li>
  <li><code>/etc/pkgforge/submit.yml</code></li>
  <li><code>~/.pkgforge/pkgforge.yml</code></li>
  <li><code>~/.pkgforge/submit.yml</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
Default values for any submit option can be set, the configuration
file format is YAML. The easiest approach is to look at the
system-wide configuration files and copy the applicable settings into
the local directory. For example, this makes it possible to avoid
having to specify the email addresses for reports every time a job is
submitted.
