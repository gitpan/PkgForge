<h2><a name="background">Background and Motivation</a></h2>

<p>We have long recognised within the computing team of the University
of Edinburgh School of Informatics that we need some mechanism for
automatically building software from source on multiple platforms
which requires minimal input and minimal effort from the user.</p>

<p>Currently we are required to have multiple machines available to
which computing officers (COs) have login access to enable them to
build packages. Due to the effort required in switching from one
platform to the next (e.g. SL5 to SL6), we typically have 2 supported
platforms at any one time and we always support both i386 and x86_64
architectures. This means that we normally need to have 4 build hosts
available and in transition periods we may need 6. These servers need
to all have the necessary set of development software packages either
installed or ready to hand (e.g. installable by yum for Redhat
systems). This creates a dependency on the availability of quite a few
servers, it also adds a maintenance burden and, worst of all, it
requires the CO to login up to 6 times, install their source code,
build the software and then submit the results. This is a manual
process which requires the CO to monitor the process for errors and
provide regular interactive feedback to move it on to the next
stage. To add to these problems, there are often subtle differences
between platforms and environments which can be troublesome during the
build process or result in broken packages being generated.</p>

<p>At various times some COs have attempted to create scripts to
workaround a lot of this overhead with varying degrees of success. It
is relatively easy to have a script which can use ssh to login and
work through the steps, checking for errors at each stage. Such a
script can even be made to do the work in parallel across the build
hosts to save waiting time. This certainly does lead to a more
reliable and reproducible build process but it is not immune to issues
such as a build host being unavailable. It also does not cope with the
situation where a build host is already working flat-out to build some
other piece of software. When something is not urgent it may be better
to wait until sufficient resources become available. A further issue
is that we regularly find platforms or specific architectures being
missed by COs due to simple forgetfulness or a lack of
awareness. Packages are often only built for the commonly used
platforms or the results are only partially submitted to the central
package repository with some sub-packages being lost in the
process. Furthermore, even with a script to handle the multiple login
issue, it still needs to be updated when new platforms are
introduced. It would be much better if a single system existed which
had the full knowledge of the supported platforms and could build the
software appropriately.</p>

<p>A number of systems (often referred to as &quot;build farms&quot;)
already exist, such as Redhat's koji, which can achieve much of what
we require. At the start of this project some time was spent
investigating and evaluating these systems but none was found to
successfully meet all of our requirements. It is not the aim of this
document to discuss the ways in which they failed to meet our needs,
the focus will solely be on the PkgForge system which was
developed.</p>

<p>One useful thing which came out of this initial investigation was
the discovery of <em>mock</em>, the Redhat package build tool. This is
used to manage a small chroot, build-requirements are automatically
installed using yum and the source package is built using the standard
rpmbuild tool. The mock tool helps to build packages in a reliable and
reproducible fashion without the need for all the build dependencies
to be already installed. It also permits the building of packages for
different platforms and architectures on a single machine providing
they are reasonably compatible. In practise this tends to means that a
single x86_86 architecture machine can be used to build packages for
both i386 and x86_64 for the current Redhat/Fedora platform and any
other Redhat/Fedora platform which was released prior to the current
platform. It is sometimes possible to build packages for newer
platforms (e.g. F14 on F13) but there is little guarantee that this
will work. In particular, we have encountered problems when important
libraries such as rpmlib have API changes. One limitation of the mock
system is that for any particular platform/architecture configuration
it is only possible to have one build in operation at once. This means
that although it is excellent for single users it is not so useful for
multiple users who end up having to wait for previous users to
complete their work. This is a fundamental issue related to the use of
chroots. It can, of course, be worked around by each user having their
own configurations and build directories but that returns the user to
needing to maintain their own build environment configurations. This
shows that some sort of automated queueing mechanism is essential. A
CO should be able to fire off their source package to be built and
forget about it until a final status report is issued. It should not
require any sort of frequent, interactive, checking to see if the
build system is idle and ready to do work. One further nice feature of
mock is that it can generate a yum repository from the results of
previous build runs. This means that it is possible to immediately use
the results of one build to satisfy the build requirements of the next
build. We often have to build large sets of software just to satisfy
the build-requirements of one particular piece of software so this
feature could be very useful.</p>

<p>It is worth noting at this point the factors which limit the speed
at which a package can be built on multiple platforms using mock. The
main factor which limits the number of mock build processes which can
be run concurrently on a single system is the number of
processors/cores available. Ideally there has to be a processor per
mock build process, anything less results in a very slow build. A
secondary factor is the disk as the mock build process uses the disk
rather intensively, this is mainly due to the various caching which is
done. Building within a local disk is more-or-less essential to
achieve a decent level of performance.  Also, having fast disks and
possibly even a separate disk per build-process helps make build
processes go a lot faster.</p>

<p>Further to the investigations into koji and mock the build systems
for other Linux distributions were examined to see what features they
provided. The Debian build infrastructure is particularly of interest
as it provides many of the features that we require. Although there
did not appear to be much opportunity for code reuse it has provided a
great deal of inspiration for the design of a distributed build system
which handles many different architectures.</p>

<p>For efficiency, the CO team in Informatics generally prefer to work
from the command-line so appropriate tools will have to be
provided. Many of the CO team regularly works from a variety of
locations, including at home as well as in the office. This means that
the tools should be installable and runnable from a wide variety of
systems (preferably including non-RPM based systems such as
Debian). There is also the need to be able to submit source packages
across foreign networks. As well as providing the ability to submit
from anywhere, an interface will be needed to provide feedback on the
build results and access to the log files. This is probably best done
through a web interface.</p>

<p>Any system developed will need to be designed such that it can cope
with builders for target platforms being unavailable for a period of
time. Any source packages submitted during a period of builder
unavailability should be queued until such time as the builder becomes
available again. This should not require any explicit actions from the
users. It should also be possible to continue to submit source
packages even when the processing of new submissions is not
active. Any submitted jobs should be stored for later processing and
queueing when the master comes back online.</p>

<p>To make the system sufficiently robust it should be designed so
that it is not overly complex. Partially, this can be achieved by
using existing infrastructure wherever applicable. For instance, the
source packages can be simply submitted into a directory where the COs
have write access rather than developing a bespoke submission system
with its own protocol and file transmission system.</p>

<p>Where possible the intention is very much that the design should
make use of existing infrastructure and tools rather than completely
re-inventing the wheel. In Informatics there are existing
authentication systems (e.g. Kerberos and cosign for the web) and an
existing network file-system (openafs) which can be utilised. As
previously mentioned there are build tools such as mock which will do
the bulk of the work. This does mean that some decisions will be made
that do not suit external users but it is hoped that workarounds will
always be possible. For example, AFS could be replaced with NFS or
submission could be done only on a certain host into the local
file-system. Going further, for example, the design should make it
possible for a submission tool using sftp to be written.</p>

<p>As well as utilising existing infrastructure the aim is to use
existing software modules wherever possible. The bulk of the code will
be written using Perl in an object-oriented style. For this, the
current &quot;best practice&quot; recognised by the wider Perl
community is to use Moose. In general, standard modules from CPAN will
be sought whenever possible. The aim is that the code should also
reach certain minimal quality standards. This can be achieved by
standardising the formatting using perltidy and checking with
perlcritic. To ensure that the code works as expected, and continues
to do so as Perl and the various modules continue to develop, a
comprehensive test suite will also be essential. As we are aiming to
support a wide range of platforms the test suite will be an important
part of porting to any new operating system where the versions of Perl
and the required modules may differ quite substantially.</p>

<p>Although the motivation for the development of the PkgForge system has
come from with the computing team in the School of Informatics it has
always been part of the considerations that the software developed
should be useful to other external groups (both within the University
and elsewhere). With this in mind the intention was that any system
developed should be reasonably platform agnostic and extensible to
suit the needs of others. Although we currently only use systems which
are RPM-based it may well be that at some point in the future we need
the ability to build software automatically on MacOSX or Debian so
that possibility should not be deliberately excluded.</p>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>Having taken into account the background and motivation previously
discussed a number of specific requirements where formulated. (These
are not in any particular order of merit).</p>

<ol>
<li>It must be possible for the user to be able to submit source packages
in a very simple and straightforward fashion which requires minimal
effort. In particular, there must be command line submission tool
which makes the setting of any options, etc., a trivial process.</li>

<li>The build process must be totally automated and not require any
interactive feedback from the user.</li>

<li>If a build is successful then all build products must be automatically
submitted to the correct location (the package &quot;bucket&quot; in Informatics
terminology).</li>

<li>The build environment must be consistent and the build process must be
reliable and reproducible.</li>

<li>It must be possible for a user to submit a job with little or no prior
knowledge of the supported platforms (other than the type of package
required, e.g. SRPM). However, it must also be possible to restrict
the set of target platforms when it makes no sense (e.g. certain
software will not build on the x86_64 architecture).</li>

<li>It must be possible to have multiple machines servicing a single
target platform. This is to allow the efficient handling of large
scale rebuilds, in particular, this will be essential when Informatics
ports all their local software to a new platform.</li>

<li>The system should be extensible so that support can be added for
platforms which do not use the RPM package format.</li>

<li>It should be possible for external users to deploy the system with
minimal effort. To achieve this all the configuration data must be in
configuration files and nothing specific to the School of Informatics
should be hardwired into the code.</li>

<li>It should be possible to submit a set of source packages all at once
for building as a single set. The results of building each piece of
software in the set would then become available for the rest of the
set. Only if all software in the set builds successfully would
anything be submitted.</li>

<li>Existing infrastructure should be used where possible to minimise the
amount of new development work that needs to be done for the system.</li>

<li>There must be a comprehensive test suite.</li>

<li>The code must meet certain quality standards and be formatted in a
standard way. The coding style should follow recognised Perl best
practises.</li>

<li>Wherever possible existing libraries should be used to aid portability
and reduce the amount of new code which has to be developed and
maintained.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="design">Design Overview</a></h2>

<p>Based on the background, motivations and requirements which have
already been discussed an outline design was developed. Each of these
parts will be discussed in greater detail in subsequent sections. This
is a simple high-lelevel overview of the system.</p>

<h3>Build Jobs</h3>

<p>Central to the design of the PkgForge system is the concept of
a <em>build job</em> which is what the user submits. A build job has a
unique identifier and consists of a set of, one or more, source
packages and some instructions which tell the system how and where the
packages should be built and submitted.</p>

<p>A build job is submitted as a directory which contains all the
source packages and a meta-data file. This directory is placed into a
standard location in the filesystem where the user has write
access. In Informatics the filesystem used is AFS so that a build job
may be submitted from anywhere.</p>

<h3>The Registry</h3>

<p>
The registry is used to store all the information necessary for
scheduling tasks. It contains the information about the current set of
supported platforms, the build daemons for the platforms and the list
of jobs along with the associated tasks. The status of each task and
job is tracked as it progresses through its lifecycle and logs are
kept of when jobs have been attempted. It, deliberately, does not
contain all the information which is submitted by the user which is in
the job meta-data file. When a build daemon needs the extra
information (such as obtaining the list of source packages to be
built) it loads the job data from the file directly. This makes it
possible to easily extend the set of information in the meta-data file
whenever necessary without having to alter the database schema.
</p>

<p>
The registry is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The incoming queue
processor and build daemons communicate directly with this database,
there is not a bespoke communication layer. It is unlikely that the
system will work as it stands with any other database type. All of the
access controls, the locking and some of the scheduling code are
written in the pgsql language. A deliberate decision was made to
utilise these features of the database as they are likely to be more
reliable and more performant than any similar features which could be
added to the PkgForge code.
</p>

<h3>Incoming Job Processor</h3>

<p>There is a single daemon (which runs on the server often referred
to as the <em>master</em>) which regularly checks the directory into
which new jobs are submitted. Whenever a new job directory is detected
the job is registered, processed and, if validated, transferred to a
different secure location and queued for the builder daemons. Various
validity checks are carried out, for example, with source RPMs they
are first checked to ensure they are valid SRPMs.</p>

<p>The queueing of a job is done by constructing the set of target
platforms based on what is available and what the user has
requested. Once the set of platforms is computed a separate <em>build
task</em> is scheduled for the job on each platform. The job and the
scheduled tasks are added to the central registry. Only the core
information required for the scheduling of jobs/tasks is copied from
the submitted job meta-data into the registry.</p>

<h3>The Build Daemons</h3>

<p>
Each active target platform has a set of, zero or more, build
daemons. The build daemons do the actual work of building packages
from the submitted sources. When there are no build daemons in
operation the new tasks will be queued awaiting the addition of a new
daemon. Each build daemon must be entered into the registry before it
can begin accepting tasks. An entry in the registry does not guarantee
that the build daemon is in anyway live and operational, it is purely
used to record which platform/architecture the build daemon supports.
</p>

<p>
The task scheduling is very basic. Each time a check of the queue is
made it is ordered according to submission date and time with the
oldest task being selected. For the sake of sanity, during this process
the table is locked so any other daemons for the same platform will
have to wait to retrieve new tasks. If a builder does not complete a
task (neither success or failure) it might put the task back onto the
queue. A task may be attempted multiple times, by multiple build
daemons and may even be retried after a build failure. The build log
tracks every attempt to build a task.
</p>

<p>
When a new task is accepted by a build daemon it goes through several
phases. Initially the list of source packages is filtered to retrieve
only those which are applicable (e.g. SRPMs for a builder that uses
mock/rpmbuild). After that an attempt is made to build each source
package in turn according to the original sequence specified by the
submitter. The behaviour upon failure is controllable by the user, it
can either be an immediate failure of the whole task or the source
package can be put to the end of the list of sources and tried again
later. The RPM builder uses the second approach by default so that it
can try to handle a set of source packages having build-requirements
upon each other. After the package building phase there is an optional
checking stage, this is done to ensure the validity of the generated
packages. Finally, if all source packages are built correctly and pass
the checks, the packages will be submitted to the appropriate
repository using pkgsubmit. In all cases after completion of a task
the log files are stored in a central &quot;results&quot; directory
which is accessible from the web interface. Optionally the build
daemons can generate reports at the end of the build process (for
example sending an email to the user who submitted the job).
</p>

<h3>The Web Interface</h3>

<p>

The first iteration of the web interface is fairly basic. It is used
to display the list of jobs and associated tasks a user has submitted
and the current status of each. For each task it is possible to
retrieve log files and the generated packages (when a task has
succeeded).
</p>

<p>
In the future the web interface may gain the capability to modify the
registry. This would allow a user to cancel and retry jobs and
tasks. It may also gain a feature for uploading jobs which would be
a very useful when a secure networked filesystem is not available.
