<h1>PkgForge - Submitting Packages</h1>

<p>The entire purpose of the Package Forge system is to make it easy
for a user to submit a set of software source packages and have them
built on multiple platforms with the products being copied into the
central repositories. Parts of this process are complex but from the
user point of view it can be considered fairly simplistically. After a
job has been submitted it is transformed into a set of tasks, one per
target platform, and they placed into queues for the package
builders. The builders select the jobs in the order of submission,
attempt the build and then run through any checks (such as running
rpmlint). If the build was successful and the checks have all passed
then the generated packages are submitted into the central package
repository. At the end of the process any requested reports are
generated. Full details of each job are always viewable through the
web interface.</p>

<p>The source packages are submitted using the <code>pkgforge</code>
command-line tool by invoking the <em>submit</em> command. There are a
number of options which can be used, the only obligatory option is
the <em>bucket</em> (explained below). For example:</p>

<pre>
pkgforge submit --bucket lcfg foo-1-2.src.rpm
</pre>

<p>It is possible to submit more than one source package as part of a
job. The builds will be attempted in the order in which they are
specified by the user. The RPM builder can use the generated packages
from building one source package as the build-dependencies for
subsequent source packages within the same build job. Further to this,
if a package fails to build then it will be put onto the back of the
queue in the hope that the error was due to missing build-dependencies
which can be satisfied within the current build job. The builder will
continue attempting to build source packages within a job until all
are successful or no more can be built. This makes it possible to
build large sets of source packages without knowing the correct
ordering required.</p>

<p>Validity checks will be carried out on each file before the build
job is submitted. This includes checking that the SRPM is valid and
that it contains a specfile with the <code>.spec</code> suffix.</p>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>

<p>If you do not know the the name of the command you require, then
the <code>pkgforge</code> tool can be invoked without any command and
it will print to the screen a list of all available commands with
short details on each. For example:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge
Available commands:

  commands: list the application's commands
      help: display a command's help screen

    submit: Submit a set of source packages for building

</pre>

<p>The <em>help</em> command can be used to get a full list of options
for any particular command. For example:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge help submit
Required option missing: bucket
pkgforge submit [-?aBcpr] [long options...]
	-c --configfile     The configuration file for this application
	--target            Location into which jobs should be submitted
	--id                The unique identifier for this job
	-? --usage --help   Prints this usage information.
	-p --platforms      The platforms on which packages should be built
	-a --archs          The architectures for which packages should be
	                    built
	-B --bucket         The bucket to which the packages will be
	                    submitted.
	-r --report         Email addresses to which build reports will be
	                    sent
	--verbose           Verbose output
</pre>

<p>Most options have a single-character short-form prefixed with a
single-dash or alternatively can be reduced to the shortest unique
string prefixed with a double-dash. For example, <code>--plat</code>
is acceptable.</p>

<p>If there is an option for which you want to specify the same value
every time the command is invoked (e.g. the email address for reports)
then it is better added into the configuration file (see below for
details).</p>

<p>The options which are most likely to be regularly useful
are <code>--platforms</code>, <code>--archs</code>, <code>--bucket</code>
and <code>--report</code> and each is explained in greater detail
below. One further option that can occasionally be useful
is <code>--id</code>. If the job identifier is not specified then a
UUID is generated but it can be useful to use an ID string which is
more meaningful to the individual (i.e. contains the user name or a
package name). Note that the ID MUST not have been used previously,
MUST be no more than 50 characters long and MUST only contain
characters in the <code>A-Za-z0-9_.-</code> set. Also beware that
there is nothing stopping other users also generating jobs using your
chosen naming scheme...</p>

<h2>Selecting the Bucket</h2>

<p>The <em>bucket</em> is only option which must be specified for each
build job. It is LCFG terminology for the repository into which a
package is stored. Typically there are different buckets for packages
with different license restrictions. Taking the School of Informatics
as an example we have:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>lcfg</dt>
  <dd>Packages which globally distributable and part of the LCFG project.</dd>
  <dt>world</dt>
  <dd>Other packages which are globally distributable.</dd>
  <dt>uoe</dt>
  <dd>Packages which can only be distributed within the University of Edinburgh.</dd>
  <dt>inf</dt>
  <dd>Packages which can only be distributed with the School of Informatics.</dd>
  <dt>devel</dt>
  <dd>Development code. Nothing in this bucket is distributed and it is regularly swept to remove old packages.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is important that a package submitted into a particular bucket
does not have dependencies which can only be satisfied by packages in
a different bucket with a more restrictive license. For example, a
package in the <em>world</em> bucket cannot depend on packages in
the <code>inf</code> bucket. To achieve this goal the set of buckets
available for satisfying build-dependencies is different depending on
the target bucket. In the School of Informatics the sets of buckets
used in build configurations are:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Target</th>
    <th align="left">Available Buckets</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">lcfg</th>
    <td align="left">base, updates, epel, lcfg</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">world</th>
    <td align="left">base, updates, epel, lcfg, world</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">uoe</th>
    <td align="left">base, updates, epel, lcfg, world, uoe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">inf</th>
    <td align="left">base, updates, epel, lcfg, world, uoe, inf</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">devel</th>
    <td align="left">base, updates, epel, lcfg, world, uoe, devel</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Selecting the Platform</h2>

<p>If no platform is specified then tasks will be registered for the
default set of platforms. The PkgForge system has two different
pre-defined groups of platforms which can be requested, these
are <code>auto</code> and <code>all</code>. The default set of
platforms is the <code>auto</code> group. Tasks can be scheduled for
any platform which is marked in the registry as <em>active</em> but it
may well be that not all active platforms are marked
as <em>auto</em>. As suggested by the name, the <em>all</em> group
selects all active platforms.</p>

<p>A job can be submitted for all active platforms like this:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge submit -B lcfg --platforms all foo-1-2.src.rpm
</pre>

<p>If a set of source packages will only build on particular platforms
then it is worthwhile restricting the target set. Any number of
platform names can be specified in a comma-separate list. For example:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge submit -B lcfg --platforms 'f13,sl6' foo-1-2.src.rpm
</pre>

<p>Note that it is not a problem for the PkgForge system if a package
is submitted for a platform and it fails to build. It is down to the
individual user to decide on whether or not a build failure is
important.</p>

<p>If a platform name is requested which is not active or not
supported then no tasks will be registered for that platform. Any
other platforms will be registered as normal, the overrall job
submission will not fail. The PkgForge web interface will flag up
build jobs which reference inactive or unsupported platforms.</p>

<h2>Selecting the Architecture</h2>

<p>Further to the possibility of restricting the target platforms it
is possible to restrict to particular architectures. Any architecture
restrictions are applied after the platform list has been
calculated. This means that it is not possible, in a single build job,
to target different architectures on different platforms
(e.g. just <code>f13/i386</code> and <code>sl6/x86_64</code> is not
possible).</p>

<p>By default all architectures are selected, this normally
means <code>i386</code> and <code>x86_64</code>. Selecting a specific
architecture can be done like this:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge submit -B lcfg --arch i386 foo-1-2.src.rpm
</pre>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>Once a job has been submitted full feedback on the progress can be
obtained from the PkgForge web interface. It is also possible to get
email reports.</p>

<h3>Email Reports</h3>

<p>Email reports can be selected by passing in an email address to
the <code>--report</code> option or by setting it permanently in the
configuration file (see below).</p>

<p>The email reports will be sent by the individual builders after
each task has completed (either success or failure). This means that
if the job is submitted for 3 platforms and 2 architectures for each
platform the user will receive 6 email reports.</p>

<p>As well as the subject and details in the body of the message, the
following email headers will be added to each report email to make it
easy to do filtering.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>X-PkgForge-Status</code> - either <code>success</code> or <code>fail</code></li>
  <li><code>X-PkgForge-Builder</code> - the name of the builder</li>
  <li><code>X-PkgForge-ID</code> - the original job ID</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Typically the pkgforge submit command will already have been
configured on a system-wide basis in
the <code>/etc/pkgforge/pkgforge.yml</code>
and <code>/etc/pkgforge/submit.yml</code> files. If the LCFG pkgforge
component is being used then this can be done using
the <code>lcfg/options/pkgforge.h</code> header. Typically the only
option which must be set is the <em>target</em> directory, which is
the location of the directory into which new jobs should be
submitted. If a networked filesystem is being used then this will
usually be the same as the setting for
the <code>pkgforge.incoming</code> resource.</p>

<p>The primary pkgforge configuration file
(<code>/etc/pkgforge/pkgforge.yml</code>) should look something like:</p>

<pre>
--- 
"accepted": '/afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/accepted/'
"incoming": '/afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/incoming/'
"results": '/afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/results/'
"website": 'https://pkgforge.example.org/'
</pre>

<p>and the submit-specific configuration file should look something like:</p>

<pre>
--- 
"target": '/afs/example.org/pkgs/pkgforge/incoming/'
</pre>

<p>Further to this the user can override any settings using a
configuration file named <code>submit.yml</code> which is stored in
the <code>.pkgforge</code> directory within the user's home
directory. In particular this is useful for permanently setting
the <em>report</em> option, like this:</p>

<pre>
report: user1@example.org
</pre>

<p>It can also be useful for permanently setting defaults for the
bucket, platform and architecture options. All settings can still be
overridden at any time from the command-line.</p>
