=head1 NAME

pkgforge - The Package Forge source code builder tool suite

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to pkgforge version 1.4.8

=head1 USAGE

    pkgforge submit --bucket lcfg

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a command-line tool which allows you to issue various commands
to the Package Forge source code build suite.

=head1 COMMANDS

There are two built-in commands:

=over

=item help [command name]

If you call the C<help> command with no arguments it will list all the
supported commands. If you also specify a particular command name it
will show all the available command-line options for that specfic
command.

=item commands

This command gives a list of all available commands.

=back

The following standard commands are each implemented with a separate
Perl module. For full documentation you need to read the perldoc for
the specific module. They are all in the C<PkgForge::App>
namespace. It is possible to extend this list with extra, locally
supplied, commands with Perl modules in the same namespace.

Note that it is possible to use the shortest unique name for a command
rather than typing the whole thing.

=over

=item submit - L<PkgForge::App::Submit>

Submits a build job for a set of source packages that you want
building.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Many of these commands can be configured via configuration files as
well as via their command line options. You should read the
documentation for the individual Perl modules to see what files are
examined.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

After successfully running a command it will exit with code zero. An
error will result in a non-zero error code.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This script uses L<PkgForge::Tool> which is L<Moose> powered and the
L<MooseX::App::Cmd> module is used to handle the command-line
interface.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<PkgForge>, pkgforge-submit(1)

=head1 PLATFORMS

This is the list of platforms on which we have tested this
software. We expect this software to work on any Unix-like platform
which is supported by Perl.

ScientificLinux5, Fedora13
